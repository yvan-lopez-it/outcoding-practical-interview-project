# Code explanation

## Project 02

This code determines if a given string is a palindrome or not.

1. This method `isPalindrome` takes a single argument `input`, which is the string that needs to be checked for being a palindrome. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the given string is a palindrome or not.
2. It declares a functional interface `Function` with a single abstract method `apply`. A lambda expression is then used to define the implementation of this method. The lambda expression takes a string `s` and returns a boolean value.
3. The implementation of the lambda expression reverses the string `s` using the `StringBuilder` class and then compares the reversed string with the original string. If the two strings are equal, the method returns `true` indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, the method returns `false`.
4. Finally, the `apply` method of the `Function` interface is called with the argument `input` to obtain the final result.

## Project 03

The code uses a backtracking algorithm to find all possible combinations of numbers in an array that add up to a given target. The program contains a `main` method and two other methods: `combinationSum` and `backtrack`.

1. The `main` method initializes an array of integers, `nums`, and invokes the `combinationSum` method with `nums` and the target value, 10.
2. The `combinationSum` method takes in an array of integers and an integer as parameters and returns all combinations that add up to the target.
3. It first creates a list, `result`, to store all the combinations and calls the `backtrack` method to find all possible combinations.
4. After the `backtrack` method is executed, the combinations in `result` are printed to the console.
5. The `backtrack` method is a recursive function that uses a backtracking algorithm to find all possible combinations.
6. The method takes in 5 parameters: `result`, `combination`, `nums`, `target`, and `start`.
7. It starts by checking if the target is less than 0, and returns if it is.
8. If the target is equal to 0, it adds the current `combination` to the `result` list.
9. If the target is greater than 0, the method loops through the `nums` array starting from the `start` index and adds the current number to the `combination`.
10. It then calls itself with the updated `combination`, `target`, and `start` values, and continues the loop until it finds all possible combinations that add up to the target.
11. If the target becomes less than 0, the method removes the last added number from the `combination` and continues the loop.

## Project 04

This code calculates the nth hexagonal number.

It takes a single integer argument from the command line and returns the corresponding hexagonal number.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Check the number of arguments passed to the program:
2. The program expects a single argument to be passed, which represents the value of n for the calculation of the hexagonal number.
3. If the number of arguments is not equal to 1, the program prints a message indicating that a single integer argument is required, and then exits.
4. Parse the argument to an integer. The argument is converted from a string to an integer and stored in the n variable.
5. Calculate the hexagonal number: The hexagonal number is calculated using the formula `n * (2 * n - 1)`. (cited source [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_number](https://))
6. The result is printed to the console, indicating the nth hexagonal number calculated.

To run this program, save the above code to a file named HexagonalNumber.java and compile it using the following command:

`javac Project04_.java`

Then, run the compiled program with an integer argument like this:

`java Project04_ 6`

This will produce the following output:

`The 6th hexagonal number is: 91`
