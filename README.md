# Outcoding Practical Interview Project
This is a Practical Interview Project for Sr. Full Stack Software Engineer position

Project 01 consists of 2 applications. One in Angular2 for FE and the other in Spring Boot as BE.

Within javaprograms are the projects from 02 to 04.

Additional Practical Interview Questions:

1.	How would you make an application testable, what do you do to ensure code quality?

To make an application testable, it's necessary to follow good software development practices such as writing modular and single responsibility code, separating the code into layers, and following inversion of control principles. (SOLID principles).
You can then write unit tests for each module, which test individual units of code in isolation, and integration tests, which test the interactions between modules. 
This can help catch bugs early in the development process and ensure that changes to the code don't break existing functionality. 

Now, to ensure code quality, you could perform code reviews, use linting tools to enforce a consistent coding style, and write automated tests that are run every time the code is changed, using a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

2.	From a software development perspective, what steps might you take, on an ongoing basis, to continually improve your skillset?

- I think I should continue staying up to date with the latest technology and industry developments by reading technical blogs, attending conferences, and participating in online communities.
- I seek out opportunities for learning, such as taking courses, working on personal projects, and participating in coding challenges.
- I ask for feedback from coworkers, mentors or interviewers, and be open to constructive criticism.
- The pair program with more experienced engineers is valuable and learn from their expertise too.
- Practice problem-solving and critical thinking skills by working through coding challenges and implementing complex systems.

3.	Provide an example of a time when you just couldn't complete all of your work on time to meet a deadline. What did you do? What was the result?

I recall a time when I was working on a project as part of a team, and I underestimated the amount of work required to complete my tasks on time. 
I then realized that I wouldn't be able to meet the deadline as the workload was more than I had anticipated. 
To resolve the issue, I approached my team lead and informed him of my situation and I worked with him to prioritize the tasks and identify which ones could be deferred to a later date.
I also sought help from other team members to complete the remaining tasks. 
At the end ofg the day I was able to complete the project on time and the team was able to deliver a high-quality product. 
This experience taught me the importance of proper time management and effective communication with my team.
